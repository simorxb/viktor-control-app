# Viktor - Control Application

The application uses the Python control library to allow you to define your plant transfer function, tune the PID, see the system response, gain margin, phase margin and delay margin of the close loop system. The PID is C(s) = kp + ki/s + kd\*s/(tau\*s+1).

This is the code needed for the Control Application at https://cloud.viktor.ai/public/control-application

Note that you need to have a Viktor account and follow the documentation at https://docs.viktor.ai/docs/welcome/ to build and publish apps.
